Auction Modeling
----------------

Package for R to estimate private-value auction models while allowing
for unobservable auction-specific heterogeneity. Extensions to the
baseline model allow for endogenous entry and observing multiple bids
per auction.

Motivation
----------

This is a test.

Examples
--------

The `beta_plot` function allows you to simulate data from a beta
distribution and plot the results.

    library(auctionmodeling)
    #MYFUNCTIONGOESHERE(withparams = TRUE)

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](man/figures/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
