## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed trailing spaces from the DESCRIPTION file.

* Added a reference to the methods paper the package is based on to the
  Description field.

* Removed unnecessary console logging from the parameter estimation routine.

* Moved the example code wrapped in `\dontrun` to a vignette "auctionr.Rmd". The remaining auction_model() example should run in < 5 seconds.
